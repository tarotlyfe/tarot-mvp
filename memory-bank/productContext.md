# TarotLyfe Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

TarotLyfe addresses the growing need for accessible, personalized spiritual wellness tools in the digital age. Modern spiritual seekers and mindfulness practitioners often struggle to find authentic, meaningful ways to engage with tarot and reflective practices online. Most existing platforms either lack personalization, feel impersonal, or don't integrate the reflective journaling component that deepens the tarot experience.

## Problems It Solves

### Primary Problems
- **Fragmented spiritual practice**: Users currently need multiple apps/tools for tarot readings, journaling, and mood tracking
- **Lack of personalization**: Generic tarot interpretations that don't consider user context or history
- **Missing reflection component**: Tarot readings without guided reflection lose much of their transformative potential
- **No progress tracking**: Users can't see patterns or growth in their spiritual/emotional journey

### Secondary Problems
- **Accessibility barriers**: Many tarot resources require physical cards or in-person readers
- **Inconsistent practice**: No structured way to maintain regular spiritual/reflective habits
- **Isolation**: No sense of personal growth tracking or pattern recognition

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey
1. **Ritual Initiation**: User opens app seeking guidance or reflection
2. **Tarot Reading**: AI-powered personalized card draw with contextual interpretation
3. **Guided Reflection**: AI-generated journaling prompts tied to the reading
4. **Documentation**: Rich-text journaling with auto-save and linking to readings
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Dashboard showing emotional trends, frequent cards, and insights
6. **Continuous Engagement**: Notifications and prompts to maintain regular practice

### Key Interactions
- **Seamless Flow**: Reading → Reflection → Journaling should feel like one continuous experience
- **Personalization**: Each interaction should feel tailored to the user's current state and history
- **Emotional Safety**: UI and interactions should feel calming, supportive, and non-judgmental
- **Progress Visibility**: Users should see their growth and patterns over time

## User Experience Goals
