## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **No TypeScript**: Project explicitly uses JavaScript only
- **Vite over Create React App**: Modern build tooling for better performance
- **Redux Toolkit**: Chosen for state management over Context API
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach with custom design system
- **Framer Motion**: For card drawing animations and UI polish
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Enable runtime theme switching
- **Atomic Design**: Component organization following atomic design principles
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design starting from mobile breakpoints

### Design Decisions Made
- **Calming, Mystical Aesthetic**: Dark themes with lavender and gold accents
- **Mobile-First Responsive**: Ensuring excellent mobile experience
- **Accessibility Focus**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target
- **Atomic Design**: Component organization following atomic design principles
- **Color Palette**: Primary lavender (spirituality), Gold (wisdom), Sage (growth), Charcoal (text)
- **Typography**: Inter (sans-serif), Crimson Text (serif), JetBrains Mono (monospace)
- **Theme System**: Light/dark mode with smooth transitions and localStorage persistence

### Pending Decisions
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js planned but not yet implemented
- **Database Schema**: Prisma schema needs to be designed
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 integration approach
- **Deployment Strategy**: Platform selection for hosting

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Organize by features rather than file types
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- **Component Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement comprehensive error handling

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually
- **Emotional Design**: UI should feel supportive and calming
- **Ritual-Like Experience**: Each interaction should feel intentional
- **Seamless Flow**: Reading → Reflection → Journaling should feel connected

### Development Patterns
- **API-First Design**: Backend APIs designed for multiple clients
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with rollback on failure
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks when AI services are unavailable
- **Security by Default**: Authentication and authorization built-in
